# Hello My Georgeous Friends in The Internet ‚óï ‚Äø ‚óï

[Today](# "11 December 2019"), I created something awesome and want to share with yall. That's my first **Text Editor App** in `Python`. It is a `Text Editor` but not so complicated yet as another the most known text editor such as `Notepad`, `Sublime Text`, `Visual Studio Code`, etc. You can run this app in Windows, Linux and MacOs as well. I hope you enjoyed this app and please feel free to download it and share with your another gorgeous friends around the world! :)

**Love yall** ~emotLove* ‚ù§

## Environment Setup

As I mentioned before, this app is built using [`Python`](https://www.python.org/ "Python's Official Website") language. Highly recommended [`Python3.x`](https://docs.python.org/3/ "Python3.8") version. I don't recommend you to install [`Python2.x`](https://docs.python.org/2/ "Python 2.7.14 the last released") because this app was built using [`Python3.x`](https://docs.python.org/3/ "Python3.8") version. And the dependency was be using on it is only [`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/tkinter.html "Tkinter Module") module which is a GUI module in [`Python`](https://www.python.org "Python's Official Website") language. Finally, if there is no [_Python Interpreter_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) on your [OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) (Operatin System) then you have to install [`Python`](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Download Here Now!") before continuing the steps below.

_Luckily_, you don't have to install this module anymore due to it is built-in module in python already. So give thanks to the [`creator of Python`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Created by Guido van Rossum") language and let's get started!
